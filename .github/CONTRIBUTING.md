## Instructions to be followed:
- Always while creating or working on a module on the first line comment the following statement `Status: active`.  

- Incase "if the module is not going to be a part of the current version development and may included in the furture", you must comment the first line of the module as `Status: not-active`. So that a new developer might not get confused.  

- `Docstring` must be declared for each and every `class` and `function`.  

- If a module is currently under development but halted for a reason, last line of the module must comment as yet to be completed.   

- This project always encourges you to follow the [__PEP 08__](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standard guidlines for code readability.  

- This project encourages you to follow the [__PEP257__](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) standard guidlines for docstring declaration.  


>These are some main and foremost things that you need to follow, So that you can create a project clean and neat.
